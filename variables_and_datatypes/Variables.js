/**
 * VARIABLES
 *
 * What is variable?
 * Variables are containers used to store data.
 *
 * How many ways can we declare variables?
 * var   - for function-scoped or globally-scoped variables (older syntax).
 * let   - for block-scoped variables that can be changed later.
 * const - for block-scoped variables that should not change once set.
 *
 * Variable Naming Conventions
 * Must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)
 * Can include letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs
 * Are case-sensitive (myVar is different from myvar)
 * Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names
 *
